    # Autobuild attempts to build any compiled languages  (C/C++, C#, Go, or Java).
    # If this step fails, then you should remove it and run the build manually (see below)
    #- name: Autobuild
    #  uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2

# Add custom build steps: After removing the autobuild step, you‚Äôll need to add custom build steps to your workflow to manually build your code. 
# You can do this by adding a new run step to your workflow and specifying the commands required to build your code. 
# For example, if you‚Äôre using Maven to build your project, you can add the following step to your workflow:
    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn clean install


    # ‚ÑπÔ∏è Command-line programs to run using the OS shell.
    # üìö See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun

    #   If the Autobuild fails above, remove it and uncomment the following three lines.
    #   modify them (or add more) to build your code if your project, please refer to the EXAMPLE below for guidance.

    # - run: |
    #   echo "Run, Build Application using script"
    #   ./location_of_script_within_repo/buildscript.sh
